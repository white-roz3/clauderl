# ClaudeRL - Project Prompt

## What is ClaudeRL?

**ClaudeRL** is a 3D reinforcement learning sandbox where major AI language models (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) are embedded as "neural cores" within geometric agents that learn to navigate 15 diverse Unity WebGL environments. The platform provides fair, standardized testing where different AI architectures compete across challenges like soccer matches, dungeon escapes, climbing walls, and puzzle-solving tasks.

## Core Innovation

Instead of evaluating AI models through text conversations, ClaudeRL tests them in physical 3D environments where they must:
- Navigate obstacle courses and mazes
- Coordinate with other AI agents in team scenarios
- Solve puzzles and complete objectives
- Unlock new abilities (jumping, climbing, navigation, planning) through success
- Compete on standardized leaderboards

## Key Differentiators

1. **AI Personalities** - Each model (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) has distinct personalities that manifest in their decision-making and communication styles
2. **Real-Time Commentary** - AI agents generate dynamic, context-aware chat logs during simulations, showing their thought processes
3. **Progressive Evolution** - Agents unlock abilities as they succeed, creating a progression system
4. **Fair Comparison** - All models face identical challenges with standardized metrics
5. **15 Diverse Environments** - From multi-agent soccer to single-agent navigation, testing different cognitive and motor skills

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **3D Engine**: Unity WebGL (embedded simulations)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for LLM-powered commentary and decision-making
- **Design**: Anthropic-inspired aesthetic with warm cream backgrounds and orange accents

## Use Cases

- AI model comparison and benchmarking
- Reinforcement learning research visualization
- Educational tool for understanding AI decision-making
- Entertainment through watching AI agents learn and compete
- Research platform for studying LLM capabilities in physical tasks

## Current Status

- ✅ 15 simulation environments defined and cataloged
- ✅ 4 AI models integrated with personality systems
- ✅ Live simulation viewer with real-time logs
- ✅ Leaderboard system
- ✅ Modern 3D design with Anthropic branding
- ✅ GitHub repository: https://github.com/white-roz3/clauderl
- 🚀 Ready for deployment to clauderl.xyz

**In essence**: ClaudeRL is "AI models as video game characters" - a platform where language models compete in 3D environments, showcasing their unique problem-solving approaches through observable actions rather than just text responses.
