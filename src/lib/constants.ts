  {
    question: "What is ClaudeRL?",
    answer: "ClaudeRL is a 3D reinforcement learning sandbox where different AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) are embedded as 'brains' within geometric shapes that learn to navigate various courses through trial and error."
  },
  {
    question: "How do abilities unlock?",
    answer: "As AI agents successfully complete challenges and overcome obstacles, they unlock new abilities like jumping, climbing, and advanced navigation. Each ability expands what the agent can do in future courses."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the evaluation work?",
    answer: "All AI models face the same courses and challenges. We measure their performance based on completion time, number of attempts, and abilities unlocked. This creates fair comparisons across different AI architectures."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the AI models actually learning in real-time?",
    answer: "The demos shown are illustrative simulations based on offline training runs. Real reinforcement learning training happens over many hours or days, so we show representative behavior patterns."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes each AI model different?",
    answer: "Each AI model has different strengths: Claude is methodical and thoughtful, ChatGPT excels at reasoning, Grok takes creative risks, and Gemini leverages multimodal understanding. These differences show up in their navigation strategies."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I train my own AI agent?",
    answer: "Currently, ClaudeRL is a demonstration platform. We're exploring ways to let users experiment with training parameters and custom courses in future versions."
